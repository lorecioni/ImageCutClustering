\section{Clustering}

The clustering phase provides for the categorization of the various segments in homogeneous groups, so that, at the end of the process, each of them have the same words.

At this stage the main goal is to be able to extract some good features from images that will be used for comparison. The aim is to construct a similarity matrix between different segments so that they can be used as input to the clustering algorithm.

Unable to establish a priori the final number of desired clusters is used \emph{Affinity Propagation}.
