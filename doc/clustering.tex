\section{Clustering}
The clustering phase consists in the categorization of the various segments in homogeneous groups, so that, at the end of the process, each cluster contains only words corresponding to the same state of birth.

To do so the previously built distance matrices, obtained by the processing of the structural and dimensional features, are utilized: the matrices are combined in a single one through a simple weighted sum.
\begin{displaymath} 
ClusteringMatrix[i,j]= StructuralMatrix[i,j]+0.5*DimensionalMatrix[i,j]
\end{displaymath}

The factor of $0.5$ was determined through extensive tests.

To utilize the vast majority of the clustering algorithms we need to know the number of desired final clusters.
Since our objective isn't having a particular number of clusters but rather having clusters with elements with certain properties we need to use an algorithm that hasn't the requirement: we have thus used the \emph{Affinity Propagation} algorithm.
