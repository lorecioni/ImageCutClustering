\section{Compiling and running notes}

This software was developed entirely in C++, and uses an open source library of image processing and analysis, \emph{Leptonica}\footnote{Leptonica, \emph{a pedagogically-oriented open source site containing software that is broadly useful for image processing and image analysis applications} -http://www.leptonica.org/}, version 1.70.

\emph{Leptonica} provides many functions for manipulating images pixel by pixel using a high-level approach. Thanks to this library for example, you can draw up a diagram of projections, crop images, or find the connected components in a portion of the image.

To compile the code, once included the library described above, it is necessary, in the case of version of \emph{GCC/G++} less than 4.7, compile with version 11 of C++ that introduces support for threads.

To run this programm use the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{-d} to specify the images directory.
\item \textbf{-t} to specify the number of threads. Default is 2.
\item \textbf{-\--lcs} to use only LCS distance for building similarity matrix.
\item \textbf{-\--l1} to use only Euclidean distance for building similarity matrix.
\end{itemize}
